# Let's Learn Godot

Everybody seems to be moving away from Unity after the instal fee blunder so I'm hoping on the bandwagon for Godot. I've tried it out before but those original projects were too ambitiouse so I'm going to make a small collection of simple games to help me get my bearings.

## Games I Might Get Around To Making
 - [x] snake
 - [ ] simple side scroll platformer
 - [ ] simple top down adventure
 - [ ] maybe something in 3d???
